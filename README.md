Hello Everyone,

I am starting a new project named "Histopathologic Cancer Detection" and goal of this project is to classify image patches as normal or malignant. 

All of this work is just for educational purposes and I am getting help from "Pytorch Computer Vision CookBook" By Michael Avendi. To get started, You first need to download the dataset. 
How you can download the dataset? He writes in his book:

"You need to create an account on the Kaggle website, join the competition, and agree with the Kaggle terms to be able to download the dataset. After signing up, visit the following link and download the competition dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/
histopathologic-cancer-detection/data. After downloading it, extract the ZIP files into a folder named data. We recommend putting the data folder in the same location as your code for ease of reference. Inside the data folder, there are two folders: train and test. The train folder contains
220,025 .tif images that are 96x96 in size. The .tif images are named with an image ID. The train_labels.csv file provides the ground truth for the images in the train folder. There are no labels for the test images. If we were to compete in the competition, we would
need to provide predictions on the test dataset and submit them to the competition for evaluation."
